#Neg Scanner's Guide to CanoScan 9000f MarkII

So, you have bought a cheap scanner and you want to get professional-quality scans out of it?
Here are some walk-through guides for the best workflows I have achieved.
All these workflows use either ScanGear, the scan software that comes with your scanner, or open source / free software easily obtainable from the internet.

By the way all these methods, except those who rely on Sane open source drivers, should be applicable to the other consumer-level scanners currently in production.
Unfortunately there are no working Sane drivers for the excellent Nikon scanners and the ubiquitous Epson scanners.
This puts CanoScan 9000f (MarkI and MarkII) in a quite unique market position: This is the only widely-available consumer-level negative scanner that provides an opportunity for real scanning experiments and eventually full software automation.
We still have some distance to travel before getting to that point, and I am determined to push this agenda forward.
I will be gradually publishing my findings as I play with this cheap and versatile toy.

The list of walkthroughs (under construction):

2. ScanGear(RAW) + NegFix8
3. Sane + NegFix8
