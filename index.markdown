# Neg Scanner's Guide to CanoScan 9000f Mark II

So, you have bought a cheap scanner and you want to get professional-quality scans out of it?
Here are some walk-through guides for the best workflows I have achieved.
All these workflows use either ScanGear, the scan software that comes with your scanner, or open source / free software easily obtainable from the internet. 
The only exception is Photoshop, that I have assumed everyone dealing with photos uses. 
But no advanced photoshop functionality has been used here, so go ahead and try the same methods on Gimp.
It should work.

By the way all these methods, except those who rely on Sane open source drivers, should be applicable to the other consumer-level scanners currently in production.
Unfortunately there are no working Sane drivers for the excellent Nikon scanners and the ubiquitous Epson scanners.
This puts CanoScan 9000f (Mark I and Mark II) in a quite unique market position: The only widely-available consumer-level negative scanner that provides an opportunity for real scanning experiments and eventually full software automation.
We still have some distance to travel before getting to that point, and I am determined to push this agenda forward.
I will be gradually publishing my findings as I play with this cheap and versatile toy.

The list of scanning guides (under construction):

1. [ScanGear + Photoshop]({{ site.baseurl }}/sg_ps/)
2. ScanGear(RAW) + NegFix8
3. Sane + NegFix8
